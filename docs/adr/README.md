# Architecture Decision Records

Records of structural decisions (data schema, persistence, auth, core
dependencies, cross-cutting patterns). See
[`docs/WORKFLOW.md` §5](../WORKFLOW.md#5-when-to-write-an-adr) for when to
add one. Don't rewrite an accepted ADR to reverse it — add a new one and
mark the old as superseded.
